Alpha Centauri (a Cen) is the closest star system to the 
Solar System at a distance of 4.37 light-years (1.34 pc).
It consists of three stars: the pair Alpha Centauri A 
and Alpha Centauri B and a small and faint red dwarf, 
Proxima Centauri, that may be gravitationally bound 
to the other two. To the unaided eye, the two main 
components appear as a single object of an apparent 
visual magnitude of -0.27, forming the brightest star 
in the southern constellation Centaurus and the 
third-brightest star in the night sky.
