Barnard's Star is a very-low-mass 
red dwarf about six light-years away from 
Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus. It 
is the fourth-closest known individual star 
to the Sun and the closest star in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Despite its proximity, 
at a dim apparent magnitude of about nine, it 
is not visible with the unaided eye; however, it 
is much brighter in the infrared than it 
is in visible light.
