Sirius is a star system and the brightest 
star in the Earth's night sky. With a visual
magnitude of -1.46, it is twice as bright as 
Canopus, the next brightest star. It has the 
designation Alpha Canis Majoris. What 
the naked eye perceives as a single star is 
actually a binary system, consisting of 
a white main sequence star, termed 
Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion 
called Sirius B.
