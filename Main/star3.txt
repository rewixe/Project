Sirius is a star system and the brightest 
star in the Earth's night sky. With a visual apparent 
magnitude of -1.46, it is almost twice as bright as 
Canopus, the next brightest star. The system has the 
Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (a CMa). What 
the naked eye perceives as a single star is actually 
a binary star system, consisting of a white main 
sequence star of spectral type A1V, termed 
Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion
of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B.
