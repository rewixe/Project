Luhman 16 is a binary brown-dwarf system 
in the southern constellation Vela at a 
distance of approximately 6.5 light-years
(2.0 pc) from the Sun. These are the closest 
known brown dwarfs and the closest 
system found since the measurement of the proper 
motion of Barnard's Star in 1916, and the 
third-closest known system to the Sun 
(after the Alpha Centauri system 
and Barnard's Star).
